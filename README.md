# List of examples

* ## [Blinky](/blinky)
    We can't miss classic "Hello, world!" of embedded software:
    a blinking LED. This example uses on-board L LED on pin 13 to demonstrate
    our Arduino sketch runtime method.

* ## [DS1721](/ds1721)
    DS1721 is a temperature sensor from Maxim Dallas. This example
    demonstrates how to use DS1721 to measure temperature.

* ## [MCP7940N](/mcp7940n)
    MCP7940N is a popular RTC (Real-Time Clock) chip from Microchip. I
    this example we present how to prototype I2C driver outside hostile
    Assembly/C/C++ environment and perform **automated hardware test**
    using *Arduino Micro*.
